  <h1>Top 10 Common Mistakes in Algebra and How to Fix Them</h1>
  <p>Learning algebra can be tricky, especially when common mistakes get in the way. Here are ten of the most frequent algebra errors and tips to avoid them.</p>

  <h2>1. Not Following the Order of Operations</h2>
  <p>Always follow PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.</p>

  <h2>2. Misplacing Negative Signs</h2>
  <p>Be cautious with subtraction and negative numbers, especially when distributing.</p>

  <h2>3. Incorrect Distribution</h2>
  <pre>
Wrong: 2(x + 3) = 2x + 3
Right: 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6
  </pre>

  <h2>4. Combining Unlike Terms</h2>
  <p>You can only combine terms with the same variable and power.</p>

  <h2>5. Forgetting to Apply Operations to Both Sides</h2>
  <p>Whatever you do to one side of the equation, do to the other side too.</p>

  <h2>6. Dividing Incorrectly Across an Equation</h2>
  <p>Only divide once you've properly isolated terms or parentheses.</p>

  <h2>7. Dropping Variables</h2>
  <p>Don't forget to carry variables through every step of simplification.</p>

  <h2>8. Assuming x² + x = x²</h2>
  <p>These are not like terms. They cannot be combined.</p>

  <h2>9. Ignoring Zero and One</h2>
  <p>Multiplying by 0 gives 0. Multiplying by 1 keeps the value unchanged. Use them smartly.</p>

  <h2>10. Skipping the Check</h2>
  <p>Always plug your solution back into the original equation to verify it works.</p>

  <p>Practice makes perfect! Understanding and avoiding these mistakes will make your algebra skills stronger.</p>
