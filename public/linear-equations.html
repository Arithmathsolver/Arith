  <h1>Solving Linear Equations – Explained with Examples</h1>
  <p>A linear equation is an equation in which the highest power of the variable is 1. It has the form <strong>ax + b = c</strong>, where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are constants.</p>

  <h2>Steps to Solve Linear Equations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine like terms on each side of the equation.</li>
    <li>Move variables to one side and constants to the other.</li>
    <li>Divide or multiply to isolate the variable.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Example 1:</h2>
  <pre>
Solve: 2x + 3 = 11
→ Subtract 3: 2x = 8
→ Divide by 2: x = 4
  </pre>

  <h2>Example 2:</h2>
  <pre>
Solve: 3x - 5 = 2x + 4
→ Subtract 2x from both sides: x - 5 = 4
→ Add 5 to both sides: x = 9
  </pre>

  <h2>Why Linear Equations Matter</h2>
  <p>Linear equations are fundamental in algebra and appear in various real-life contexts such as budgeting, distance-speed-time problems, and business planning.</p>

  <p>Practice solving different forms of linear equations to build a strong foundation in algebra!</p>
