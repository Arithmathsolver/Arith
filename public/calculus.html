  <h1>What Is Calculus? Basics You Should Know</h1>
  <p>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on change. It’s divided into two main areas: <strong>differential calculus</strong> and <strong>integral calculus</strong>.</p>

  <h2>1. Differential Calculus</h2>
  <p>This area is concerned with the concept of a derivative. It helps you understand how things change at a particular moment. For example, the speed of a car at a specific second is found using derivatives.</p>

  <h2>2. Integral Calculus</h2>
  <p>Integral calculus deals with accumulation and area. It helps you calculate things like the area under a curve or the total distance traveled by an object over time.</p>

  <h2>Real-Life Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Engineering and physics problems</li>
    <li>Economics – calculating cost, revenue, and profit</li>
    <li>Biology – modeling population growth</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Basic Terms to Know</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Function:</strong> A relationship between input and output</li>
    <li><strong>Limit:</strong> What a function approaches as input approaches a value</li>
    <li><strong>Derivative:</strong> Instantaneous rate of change</li>
    <li><strong>Integral:</strong> The total area under a curve</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Calculus is essential for higher-level math and science. Once you understand its basics, many complex problems become manageable.</p>
