  <h1>Tips to Ace Your Math Exams</h1>
  <p>Math exams can be challenging, but with the right approach, you can succeed. Here are some practical tips to help you perform your best.</p>

  <h2>1. Understand Concepts, Don’t Memorize</h2>
  <p>Focus on understanding how and why formulas work instead of just memorizing them.</p>

  <h2>2. Practice with Past Papers</h2>
  <p>Solving past exam papers helps you get familiar with question types and manage time effectively.</p>

  <h2>3. Identify Your Weak Areas</h2>
  <p>Spend more time on topics you find difficult. Don’t avoid them — tackle them early.</p>

  <h2>4. Use Flashcards for Formulas</h2>
  <p>Keep key formulas on flashcards or a cheat sheet and review them regularly.</p>

  <h2>5. Solve Problems Daily</h2>
  <p>Consistency is key. Solve a few math problems every day to keep your skills sharp.</p>

  <h2>6. Don’t Skip Steps</h2>
  <p>Write down each step clearly. It helps avoid careless mistakes and earns method marks.</p>

  <h2>7. Stay Calm During the Exam</h2>
  <p>If you get stuck, move to the next question and come back later. Don’t panic.</p>

  <p>With good preparation and a positive mindset, you can boost your confidence and excel in math exams.</p>
