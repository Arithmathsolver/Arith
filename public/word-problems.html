  <h1>Step-by-Step Guide to Solving Word Problems</h1>
  <p>Math word problems can be tricky, but with a clear strategy, they become manageable. Here’s a step-by-step method to help you solve them confidently.</p>

  <h2>1. Read the Problem Carefully</h2>
  <p>Understand what is being asked. Read the problem at least twice to grasp all the details.</p>

  <h2>2. Identify Key Information</h2>
  <p>Highlight or write down important numbers, units, and keywords (like total, difference, product).</p>

  <h2>3. Define Variables</h2>
  <p>If the problem involves unknowns, assign variables. For example: Let x = number of apples.</p>

  <h2>4. Set Up the Equation</h2>
  <p>Use the information from the problem to form an equation or system of equations.</p>

  <h2>5. Solve the Equation</h2>
  <p>Use algebra or arithmetic to solve for the unknown variable.</p>

  <h2>6. Check Your Answer</h2>
  <p>Plug the value back into the original problem to verify it makes sense.</p>

  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <pre>
Problem: Sarah has 3 more apples than John. Together, they have 13 apples. How many apples does each have?

Solution:
Let x = John's apples
Then Sarah has x + 3 apples
Total: x + (x + 3) = 13
→ 2x + 3 = 13
→ 2x = 10
→ x = 5
John: 5 apples, Sarah: 8 apples
  </pre>

  <p>Practice regularly and use this structured method to improve your word problem skills!</p>
